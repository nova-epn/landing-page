    title: 'CERN Summer Student Programme 2024 (Member and Non-Member State)',
    logo: '/interships/cern.jpg',
    place: 'Geneva, Switzerland',
    company:'CERN',
    companyDescription: 'At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. Using the worlds largest and most complex scientific instruments, they study the basic constituents of matter - fundamental particles that are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives physicists clues about how particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. Find out more on home.cern.',
    jobDescription: 'Take part in CERN’s Summer Student Programme! Over a period of 8 to 13 weeks, you will work on an advanced technical project in an experimental or engineering team. During this unique and exciting time, you can attend a series of lectures specially prepared for you where experts and scientists from around the world share their knowledge about a wide range of topics in the fields of theoretical and experimental particle physics, engineering and computing. Visits to the CERN facilities, as well as discussion sessions and workshops are also key features of the programme. Find out more on the Summer Student information page. A short report on your work and project at CERN will be expected at the end of your stay.',

You will remain registered as a student during your stay at CERN. If you expect to graduate during European summer 2024 (as of May), you are also eligible to apply. You have not worked at CERN before with any other status (Technical Student, Trainee, User or other status) for more than 3 months and you have not been previously a Summer Student at CERN.

In return, CERN will provide you with: A contract of association of 8 to 13 weeks* to work on a technical project. An extensive physics lecture programme (students will also be able to attend a series of IT lectures organized by Openlab). A 92 CHF per calendar day (net of tax) subsistence allowance to cover the cost of accommodation and meals in the Geneva area for a single person for the whole contract duration. A travel allowance on a lump sum basis paid at the end of your stay to help you with the cost of travel between Geneva and your residence at the time of the selection committee. Coverage by CERN’s comprehensive Health Insurance scheme (contribution already deducted from allowance).** Assistance to find accommodation on the CERN site or nearby. * Candidates coming from a CERN Non Member State country can stay for a duration of 8 weeks only. (Find here the list of CERN Member and Associate Member States). **The few students who are paid directly from a national funding agency have to come to CERN with their own insurance coverage.',
    possibleArrivalDates: 'Every Monday from beginning to end of June, namely 3 June, 10 June*, 17 June, 24 June and 1 July 2024.',
    requiredDocumentation: 'You will need the following documents, clearly labelled (e.g. “CV”, “Motivation letter”, “Academic transcript”, etc.) and in PDF format to complete your application: A CV. A copy of your most recent academic transcript giving an overview of your marks (if you download it from your university portal please make sure there is no protection so that we can open it). Two mandatory reference letters (dated less than 12 months), from your lecturers and/or previous internships.',
